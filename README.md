# Introduction_To_Machine_Learning
Tasks for Introduction to Machine Learning Course at ITMO University.

[First Task](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Introduction_To_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Basics%20Statics%20Metrices.ipynb), is about calculating simple statical 
metrices: sample median, variance estimate, sample mean, and standard deviation. 

[Second Task](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Introduction_To_Machine_Learning/blob/main/KNN.ipynb), is about applying KNN algorithm using Manhattan and Euclidean distances.

[Third Task](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Introduction_To_Machine_Learning/blob/main/LogisticRegression.ipynb), is about training a Logistic Regression model on a dataset, then applying the model on test data and finding probabilities of the assigned classes to the test dataset, and finally calculating Recall, Precision, and AUC.

[Fourth Task](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Introduction_To_Machine_Learning/blob/main/K-Means.ipynb), is about applying K-Means clustering algorithm on a dataset and calculating the distances from the dataset points to the centroids.
